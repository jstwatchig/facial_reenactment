# Facial Re-enactment

This notebook aims to generate a facial mask for the given `source` video based on frames from the `target` video. To get a gist of the work, please refer to the following [paper](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/siggraph17_obama.pdf)

P.S. Before running the code, make sure to have 4 folders, specifically `inter`, `internal`, `source` and `target` in your project folder. Also, check `check_real_time_latest` for the updated code.
